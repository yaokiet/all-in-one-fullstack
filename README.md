### Project Overview ###
The Work-from-Home (WFH) Tracking System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of managing flexible work arrangements for businesses. It provides a centralized portal for staff to apply for regular or ad-hoc WFH days, and for managers, HR, and senior management to effectively track, approve, and oversee employee schedules. Built with scalability in mind, the system aims to enhance efficiency and transparency in managing flexible work environments.

### Key Features: ###
- **Staff Work Arrangement Management**: Employees can view their schedules, apply for work-from-home days, and manage existing arrangements.
- **Team & Department Schedule View**: Managers and Directors can easily view their teams' schedules, ensuring proper resource planning.
- **Approval Workflow**: Managers can approve or reject flexible work requests, with the ability to revoke approvals for urgent needs.
- **Organizational Overview**: HR and senior management have access to organization-wide schedules to track overall staff presence and plan resources effectively.
- **Mobile & Desktop Friendly**: The system is designed to be responsive, ensuring accessibility from both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Security & Role-Based Access Control**: Access to different features is determined by the user's role (e.g., Staff, Managers, HR, Senior Management).
- **Cloud-Based and Scalable**: Deployed on public cloud infrastructure, the system is built to scale as the organization grows.

### Technology Stack ###
