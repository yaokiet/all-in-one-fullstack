Built with scalability in mind, the system aims to enhance efficiency and transparency in managing flexible work environments.

- **Organizational Overview**: HR and senior management have access to organization-wide schedules to track overall staff presence and plan resources effectively.
- **Mobile & Desktop Friendly**: The system is designed to be responsive, ensuring accessibility from both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Security & Role-Based Access Control**: Access to different features is determined by the user's role (e.g., Staff, Managers, HR, Senior Management).
